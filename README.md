# Data-Structures



This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in both Python and Java. Each data structure is demonstrated with practical examples to illustrate its functionality and efficiency. Understanding these data structures is crucial for effective data management and algorithm development.

Data Structures Included:
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Graph traversal algorithm exploring vertices level by level.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Graph traversal algorithm exploring as far as possible down each branch before backtracking.
Binary Search Tree (BST): Data structure where each node has at most two children, with left children smaller and right children larger.
Deque: Double-ended queue allowing efficient insertion and removal of elements from both ends.
Stack: Linear data structure following Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
Queue: Linear data structure following First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
